# text-editor

VIM/NeoVIM/Emacs Evil Mode/Helix/Kakoune -like cross-platform terminal based text editor

</div>

The plan is to create a text editor that can edit (almost) anything and (almost) anywhere.
Like a local config file, or a level.dat NBT file in a remote server over both SSH and Docker.

Remote editing should work like TRAMP in Emacs.

Buffers have a mode for the content type, like text, hex, NBT, or other binary formats.
